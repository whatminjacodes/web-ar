# web-ar
An example of how to create AR for web and how to test it (locally)

## What's needed
- mobile device that supports AR (I'm using OnePlus 7T Pro)
- Google Chrome 81+ on Android and Mozilla WebXR Viewer on iOS (I have Google Chrome 88)
- text editor/IDE (I use Visual Studio Code)

## How it works
- www/index.html has the website functionality
- www/css/style.css has the stylesheet
